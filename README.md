1. Download and install latest build of Official Tarkov
2. After install and/or patching successfully play one offline game (at least you get to spawn in game then you can disconnect of the game and close it)
3. Download SPT-AKI Installer from official site
    - SPT-AKI Installer required some dependency such as .NET etc. you can install that beforehand or open up the program and click through "X" mark to install
4. Create new folder called "SPT-AKI" and put SPT-AKI Installer into that folder

7. run Aki-server.exe once to make sure that Fika generate necessary files.
